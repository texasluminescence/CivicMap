# CivicMap 

**Connecting Austin residents to local political events that matter to them.**

CivicMap is a web platform that solves the fragmented discovery of civic engagement opportunities. Instead of checking multiple websites, users get personalized recommendations for city council meetings, town halls, community forums, and political events based on their interests.

## üéØ Problem We're Solving

- **Fragmented Discovery:** Political events are scattered across city websites, Facebook, Eventbrite, and email lists
- **Information Overload:** Too many irrelevant events, no way to filter by topics you care about
- **Lack of Context:** Event descriptions are vague‚Äîis this a routine meeting or a heated debate?

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Centralized Event Feed:** All Austin political events in one place
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Set your interests (Housing, Environment, Education, etc.) and see relevant events first
- **Smart Categorization:** ML-powered auto-tagging of event topics
- **Tone Classification:** Know if an event is informational, contentious, or action-oriented before attending
- **Save Events:** Bookmark events you want to attend
- **User Accounts:** Personalized experience with secure authentication
